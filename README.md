2. A GitHub account that will be used for the CTI-110 course

3. A GitHub repository intended to be used to complete assignments for the CTI-110 course... Also, I made it private because I don't want my name and school to be public with data collection agencies and AI on the loose.

4. I followed the instructions listed in the GitHub Assignment.docx document up until step 12 where the instructions became unclear as they appear to have been listed out of order. At which point I reviewed the CTI-110 Weekly Help Session-20240922_130456-Meeting Recording.mp4 video which informed me to open the README.md file as a text document.

# About Me

## My Interests

* I enjoy making music and playing music on the Piano, Alto Saxophone, Tenor Saxophone and Clarinet.

* I like... I _have learned to tolerate_ Blender's **lovely** interface to create 3D models for various animations, games and other projects.

* I like playing and critiquing video games, particularly by looking at various ideas that fall short and noting how they can be innovated or improved on.

* I've been toying around with code since I was around 10 years old using various websites like Scratch and Roblox. I'm currently working on a large scale Roblox project right now which I unfortunately can't share any details about. (...Yes, I know. I'd use Unreal, but Roblox STILL offers both free servers **and** free publishing in _this_ economy? That 70/30 profit split is an absolute _steal._)

* Overall I've always been facinated by computers and digital art and so I want to learn more languages that I can use to create my own programs, apps and games. 

## Websites I recommend
 * [The Models Resource](https://www.models-resource.com/) - This is essentially a digital museum where you get to download and closely observe various 3D models. I often use this website to view model polygon counts, discover new techniques and take note of best practices to implement when creating my own 3D assets.
 
 * [Sound Effects Wiki](https://soundeffects.fandom.com/wiki/Sound_Effects_Wiki) - An absoulutly ludicrous labor of love from many dedicated individuals who exhaustively document instances of various sound effects used in media. I like to use the site when I'm unable to find a specific sound effect from a movie, TV show or cartoon that I would like to implement into my own project. Simply search for a show, find the correct season, scroll down to the episode, and try clicking the listed sounds with the description or onomonopia which sounds closest to the desired sound (i.e. "Swish" "KABOOM" "Bonk" ). The pages often include samples of the desired sound to make searching through the library faster. (Note: The ads are _quite_ aggresive, **particularly** on mobile devices.)
  
 * [The Prestige Channel on YouTube](https://youtube.com/@prestige8477?si=p115ZfXhyoWTNS1m) - There's a lot of things I _**like**_ about this channel. Not only do I find them endlessly entertaining, I _**subscribe**_ to the views they express, as the _**comments**_ they _**share**_ offer a balanced perspective on how digital games can be viewed and critiqued. (Here it is again in case you missed it: [Prestige Youtube Channel])
